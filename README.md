# Tracker: A Next.js Project Management Platform

Tracker is a web application that helps teams collaborate and manage their projects efficiently. Tracker is inspired by Jira, a popular project management tool, but offers a simpler and more user-friendly interface. Tracker allows users to create projects, assign tasks, track progress, and communicate with team members.

Tracker is built with Next.js 14, a React framework that enables fast and scalable web development. Tracker uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features. Tracker also leverages the following technologies:

- Tailwind: A utility-first CSS framework that helps create custom designs without writing much CSS code.
- Shadcn: A library that provides a collection of UI components for Next.js applications.
- PostgreSQL: A relational database system that stores and manages the data for Tracker.
- Prisma: An ORM (object-relational mapping) tool that simplifies database access and schema management.
- Zod: A library that validates and parses data types in TypeScript.
- Next Auth: A library that handles authentication and authorization for Next.js applications.

Tracker is a personal project that is currently under development.
